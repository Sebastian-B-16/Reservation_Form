# Reservation_Form
My attempt to create a friendly User Interface. 
    The application i like to call it RezRes is made with C# Visual Forms and SQLite 
    This is the skeleton of what it could be an application for reservation management at any restaurant. 
How it works ? ...
    1)First time you open the application Log-In Forms pops-up, but if you dont have the database already on your computer,
you need to make a fresh simply account that contains only the username and a password. 
    1.1) If you have the database, you can log in with your account. 
    2) On the MainForm you will find a menu on the left side where you can navigate to reservation tab or if youre admin, to MyRestaurant tab.  and some other tabs that for now just shows some details about the application. 
    3) On reservation tab you find the restaurants you can interact with and join their page on application. 
    4) Every Restaurant has tables, when you click on a table, an Form will pop up where you can  store data about your reservation (ex: date, name , nr. pers)

The data is stored in database and if you're the admin of your restaurant you can see on a panel on right side so your staff can manage the incoming reservations.
